# How to use Personal Music Player called FruityPlayer

This will be documented soon, until then you could try to figure it out yourself by looking at the code if you can't do that then please wait until this is finally documented very soon with how to do it.
Just a notice, you need python to run this FruityPlayer(The personal music player.).

**NOTE: I have commented things that shows you where to modify the code, just search for (PERSONAL GUIDE) using CTRL+F in your text/code editor. If this still isn't woring out for you...just wait until I add it to the README.**
